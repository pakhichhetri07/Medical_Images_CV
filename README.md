This project tackles real-world challenges in Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) imaging, where videos are noisy and artifact-prone rather than clean benchmarks. It provides an end-to-end pipeline for preprocessing raw EUS data, removing borders and artifacts, and training a transfer learning–based deep learning model for disease classification.
